# .gitignore DIME template
# https://github.com/worldbank/DIMEwiki/tree/master/Topics/GitHub
#
# (assumes iefolder folder structure but can be modified, see
# gitignore_template_general if you are not using iefolder)
# We recommend that you create a .gitignore file using GitHub's tools and
# replace the content of that file with the content of this file. Otherwise
# you have to rename this file .gitignore. But if you rename the fine in a
# regular folder window PCs and Macs are likely to keep the file extension
# so that the file ends up being names .gitignore.txt. Code editors like, Atom,
# can edit the file extension, but if you are not familiar with how to do that,
# we recommend that you generate an ignore file using GitHub and simply replace
# the content of that file.
